      <li>We did our first show <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/summary">HAYAVADANA</a> written by Girish Karnad Ji, directed by our very own young director Mr. Abhishek Mudgal on Feb 1, 2011 at Ravindra Manch, Jaipur in collaboration with Shri Radhe Prarabdh Smriti Sanstha.
    We got this story of HAYAVADANA and this concept from one of our groupmate Ms Chaitali Gambhir Wadhwa, and being the first project it was very tough and challenging for us to fulfill on the expectations.
    But, we got very good response from media as well as from senior theatre personalities, with the scope of improvement.</li>
